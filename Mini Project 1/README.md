In this mini project, our group investigated the performance of two regression models, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and decision trees. The main objectives were to visualize raw and dimension-reduced data trends and predict hospitalization cases from search trends for COVID-19 symptoms within various sub-regions of the United States. Because of the number of variables, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce dimensionality of the data, and better classify the data structure. Clustering was optimized using the elbow method to establish an appropriate number of clusters and minimize the computational cost of the algorithm.
